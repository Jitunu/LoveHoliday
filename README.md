# List Flight Paths

## Overview

This Application calculates all possible flight paths and their costs between two locations based on a north-to-south flight cost matrix.


The program accepts two inputs:

Source location (e.g., "Castle Black").
Destination location (e.g., "King's Landing").
It outputs all possible flight paths and their total costs, e.g.:
```
Castle Black -> Winterfell -> Riverrun -> King's Landing: 125
Castle Black -> Winterfell -> King's Landing: 65
Castle Black -> Riverrun -> King's Landing: 150
Castle Black -> King's Landing: 90

```
## Features

* Validates input to ensure a valid source and destination are provided.
* Displays all possible flight paths between the source and destination with costs.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.
* IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE).
* For Unix/Linux users: A terminal supporting shell scripts.
* For Windows users: Git Bash or Command Prompt.


## Build

**Using** ``` build.sh ```

To build the project, run the provided build script:

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
   ./build.sh
```
### On Windows:
```
Use Git Bash to run:  ./build.sh
```
### What Happens During Build:

* The script creates a bin directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
* All .java files from the src/main/java/com/loveholiday directory are compiled into .class files in the bin directory.
* If the build fails, an error message is displayed.

## Run

**Using** ``` list-flight-paths.sh ```

To execute the program, use the provided run script:

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
   ./bin/list-flight-paths "Castle Black" "King's Landing"
```

### On Windows
```
Use Git Bash to run:  ./bin/list-flight-paths "Castle Black" "King's Landing"
```

## Expected Outputs
### Example Input 1:
```
./bin/list-flight-paths "Castle Black" "King's Landing"
```
### Output:
```
Castle Black -> Winterfell -> Riverrun -> King's Landing: 125
Castle Black -> Winterfell -> King's Landing: 65
Castle Black -> Riverrun -> King's Landing: 150
Castle Black -> King's Landing: 90
```

## Error Cases:
* **Missing Arguments:**
```
Please provide Source and Destination location
```
* **Invalid Source or Destination**
```
Error: Invalid location name. Please provide valid source and destination.
```
